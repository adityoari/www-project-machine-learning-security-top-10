Hi @msnishanth9001 thanks for the PR.

Is the intent of this PR to mirror or to fix formatting issues? Or both?

At this stage the repo for https://mltop10.info is done manually because it needs a manual run of 'quarto' to generate the files. 

The rendering of EPUB and PDF at this stage is more critical then worrying about the mirroring portion IMHO.

Hi @shsingh can you please assign me this issue.

The intent is to do both fix mirror and formatting issues. Once the formatting issue is fixed the ePUB generation will be fixed.

the following WF PR will publish ePUB and PDF.

The Top 10 list is being rendered using Markdown at https://mltop10.info

The site is being rendered using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and the files from https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/tree/master/docs are mirrored to https://github.com/mltop10-info/mltop10.info

Currently a manual process is run for the https://github.com/mltop10-info/mltop10.info locally to render the HTML and PDF outputs which are stored in https://github.com/mltop10-info/mltop10.info/tree/main/docs and used by Github Pages.

The rendering for PDF is currently using the default method of LaTeX - example at: https://github.com/mltop10-info/mltop10.info/blob/main/docs/OWASP-Machine-Learning-Security-Top-10.pdf

Quarto has a lot of formatting options for generating PDF and this needs to be explored to make the PDF and ePUB formats look more presentable.

### What would you like to report?

There is a comprehensive existing body of work at: https://ethical.institute

The intent would be to review the [current Top 10 list in this project](https://owasp.org/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/) and:
- merge content where appropriate
- create new content missing 
- suggest improvements for areas/scope not curently covered

Hi @axsaucedo I hope the above comment makes sense. I would love for you to contribute to this given your familiarity and ownership of the https://ethical.institute content.

I see this potentially taking a bit of time as there is a large amount of content at your site to potentially look at merging.

This could also be an opportunity to look at the current Top 10 list categories in this project to see if they need amending.

the following is an initial review taken from Slack logs: https://owasp.slack.com/archives/C04PESBUWRZ/p1677192099712519

by @robvanderveer


---
Dear all,
I did a first scan through the list to mainly look at taxonomy. Here are my remarks.
1.
ML01
In 'literature' the term ‘adversarial’ is often used for input manipulation attacks, but also for data poisoning, model extraction etc. Therefore in order to avoid confusion it is probably better to rename the ML01 adversarial attack entry to  input manipulation?
2.
It is worth considering to add ‘model evasion’ aka black box input manipulation to your top 10? Or do you prefer to have one entry for input manipulation all together?
3.
ML03
It is not clear to me how scenarios 1 and 2 work. I must be missing something. Usually model inversion is explained by manipulating synthesized faces until the algorithm behaves like it recognizes the face.
4
ML04
It is not clear to me how scenario 1 works.
Standard methods against overtraining are missing form the ‘how to prevent’ part. Instead the advice is to reduce the training set size - which typically increases the overfitting problem.
5
ML05
Model stealing describes a scenario where an attacker steals model parameters, but generally this attack takes place by ways of black box: gathering input-output pairs and training a new model on it.
6
ML07
I don’t understand exactly how the presented scenario should work. I do know about the scenario where a pre-trained model was obtained that has been altered by an attacker. This matches the description.
7

Isn’t model skewing the same as data poisoning? If there’s a difference, to me they are not apparent from the scenario and description.

ML10 is called Neural net reprogramming but I guess the attack of changing parameters will work on any type of algorithm - not just neural networks. The description also mentions changing the training data, but perhaps that is better left out to avoid confusion with data poisoning?

>In 'literature' the term ‘adversarial’ is often used for input manipulation attacks, but also for data poisoning, model >extraction etc. Therefore in order to avoid confusion it is probably better to rename the ML01 adversarial attack entry to >input manipulation?

It is worth considering to add ‘model evasion’ aka black box input manipulation to your top 10? Or do you prefer to have one entry for input manipulation all together?

It is not clear to me how scenarios 1 and 2 work. I must be missing something. Usually model inversion is explained by manipulating synthesized faces until the algorithm behaves like it recognizes the face.

It is not clear to me how scenario 1 works.
Standard methods against overtraining are missing form the ‘how to prevent’ part. Instead the advice is to reduce the training set size - which typically increases the overfitting problem.

Model stealing describes a scenario where an attacker steals model parameters, but generally this attack takes place by ways of black box: gathering input-output pairs and training a new model on it.
