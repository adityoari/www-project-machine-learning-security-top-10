### Type

Suggestions for Improvement

### What would you like to report?

For example in Top10 for LLM there's this page with a summary of each of the vulnerabilities, which I think would be pretty useful to have in Top10 for ML as well. 

Sometimes  when you e.g. work on some slides for a presentation, you just want to get a short summary of each of the vulnerabilities. In my opinion including such a page in Top10 for ML would be an improvement: 

![summary](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/assets/64902909/0bc2b1c8-43a0-4a5d-b549-71cf83e897c1)

Hi @mik0w is the suggestion to create a summary page? Or to look at enhacing the introductory sections within each of the ML risks so that they can be used as a summary? Or both? 

In either case I think this is a good idea, let me get started on it.
