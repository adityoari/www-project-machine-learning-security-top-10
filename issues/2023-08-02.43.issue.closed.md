Create a set of guidelines for how to consume the information presented in the Top 10 based on roles
 
Example roles:
- MLOps/MLEng practitioner
- Appsec practitioner

.. etc

Initial Idea - an umbrella of comprehensive 'nexts-steps.md' resembling a Venn diagram that highlight the intersections between Ethical/Privacy/ML10/LLM10 (i.e. representing efforts from various foundations) which can help tell logical relation between for ex ML and LLM and also there distinct roles and applications where it can also help any practitioner (ops, infra, soft, ml-eng. data-sci etc...) by indicating where they can find relevant resources to support their daily tasks.

The ultimate goal of this initiative is to unify all these efforts under a single umbrella, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing across different disciplines and specialties. Open to opinion's.

@sagarbhure 
Neat. I'm picturing 'swim lanes' for different roles, and process steps linked with arrows in an iterative process flow?

The analogy provided about the guideline is akin to a traffic police officer directing vehicles to take their respective lanes. It's great to see such analogies connecting real-life solutions to problems, as they effectively simplify things and add a new dimension to my thoughts. Thank you for that!

More analogies ?  Would love to see if you are open on contributing to this mission.

Hi @mik0w thanks for your initial work on getting a draft page up for [guidelines](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/blob/master/GUIDELINES.md)

I've broken down each role into a separate task to allow those with expertise in each role to provide feedback and contribute. This means we will have a document for each type of role mentioned.
