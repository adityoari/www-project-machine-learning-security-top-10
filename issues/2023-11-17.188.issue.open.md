### Type

Suggestions for Improvement

### What would you like to report?

**Context**
One of the parts of the supply chain in modern ML systems is MLOps software - like i.e. MLFlow, Prefect etc. Those systems are vulnerable to classic web based attacks and they seem to be "misconfured by default". I've described it here: https://hackstery.com/2023/10/13/no-one-is-prefect-is-your-mlops-infrastructure-leaking-secrets/ or here: https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow/issues/1145 

**Suggestion for improvement**
I'd suggest including MLOps-related vulnerabilities in the ML06 (or maybe in some other categories as well? I am open for suggestions).

In my view it should be in ML06, However is should be better renamed with ML from AI supply chain i believe to keep ourself distinct, How would you recommend adding these in the existing ML06, keeping the attacks generic to other packages

Hi @mik0w I definitely think we should look at including the ecosystem of MLOps software. I am not sure that it all falls within  supply chain though. Keen to hear your thoughts on this.
