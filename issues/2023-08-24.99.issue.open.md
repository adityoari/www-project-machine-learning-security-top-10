#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/412800?v=4" width="50">[shsingh](https://github.com/shsingh) opened issue at [2023-08-24 21:34](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/issues/99):

The Top 10 list is being rendered using Markdown at https://mltop10.info

The site is being rendered using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and the files from https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/tree/master/docs are mirrored to https://github.com/mltop10-info/mltop10.info

Currently a manual process is run for the https://github.com/mltop10-info/mltop10.info locally to render the HTML and PDF outputs which are stored in https://github.com/mltop10-info/mltop10.info/tree/main/docs and used by Github Pages.

The rendering for PDF is currently using the default method of LaTeX - example at: https://github.com/mltop10-info/mltop10.info/blob/main/docs/OWASP-Machine-Learning-Security-Top-10.pdf

Quarto has a lot of formatting options for generating PDF and this needs to be explored to make the PDF and ePUB formats look more presentable.
