- [ ] Is there existing cheatsheets at [OWASP Cheatsheets](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/Glossary.html)
- [ ] If there is an existing cheatsheet, does it need updating at the source to cater for machine learning use cases?
- [ ] Is there a need for a new cheatsheet topic?
- [ ] Add existing or new cheatsheet as a reference to the Top 10 risk document

Example Cheatsheet: [Input Validation Cheatsheet](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.md)

Example of Top 10 risk referencing cheatsheets: [ML01 Input Manipulation Attacks - Cheatsheets](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/blob/master/docs/cheatsheets/ML01_2023-Input_Manipulation_Attack-Cheatsheet.md)

adding @yodap-dg as potential lead to this due to his request for taking lead on the risk document.

adding @sagarbhure and @shsingh as backup
