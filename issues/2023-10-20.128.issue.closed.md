Construct workflow to clone the Top 10 attack's MD File to the Repo https://github.com/mltop10-info/mltop10.info. 

So that all changes to attack scenarios are pushed by WF rather than human interaction.

Hi @msnishanth9001 

commented on #129 

workflow for mirroring is at this stage less important then rendering of the markdown into pdf and epub.
