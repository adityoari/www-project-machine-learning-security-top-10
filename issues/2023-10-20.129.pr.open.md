# [\#129 PR](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10/pull/129) `open`: fix ePUB and WF to push updates to Repo

this PR contains fix to #99 and #128 

1. Workflow to automate mirror to the https://mltop10.info/ host GitHub repo.
2. Fixes MD files, so the ePUB renders without errors.
3. Fixes alignment of tables.

note, the data in table arrangement is not good so the ePUB variant has jumbled data. This can be revisited once the tabular data is fixed.

Note, this requires a GitHub token of the MLTOP10 Repo, saved with name COPY_TOKEN to do the WF push.

Hi @msnishanth9001 thanks for the PR.

Is the intent of this PR to mirror or to fix formatting issues? Or both?

At this stage the repo for https://mltop10.info is done manually because it needs a manual run of 'quarto' to generate the files. 

The rendering of EPUB and PDF at this stage is more critical then worrying about the mirroring portion IMHO.

Hi @shsingh can you please assign me this issue.

The intent is to do both fix mirror and formatting issues. Once the formatting issue is fixed the ePUB generation will be fixed.

the following WF PR will publish ePUB and PDF.
