Hello, I've created a list of projects and SIGs similar to OWASP Top10 for ML Security. I don't know what is a suggested format, but I think I've included the most renowned resources regarding AI/ML security.

This is great! Thanks.
- Would it be better if we structure these into categories for ex: usescases/domain/industry.
- A description summary etc..

This would help to unify the effort of all the initiatives and mapping it to respective practitioners(ML/Data/Infra/Ethical/Privacy) can refer to the correct standard w.r.t their usecases.

Open to suggestions.
